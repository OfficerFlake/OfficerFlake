Add Your Strong Name Key File
=============================
Put your Strong Name Key (*.snk) in this folder to sign the assemblies with your developer name!

No default key has been provided, as this would defeat the purpose of signing if everyone shared a signing key.



How To Create a Strong Name Key File
====================================
You can create your own key using the Visual Studio Developer Console.

1) Hit "Start" from Windows, then type "dev" - you should see the developer console show up.
2) In the dev console type "CD \" to move to the root of your drive.
3) Run the command "sn -k SigningKey.snk" to create your strong name key pair.
4) Your new key should be in the root of your current drive (c:)
5) Just cut it and paste that file to this folder.
